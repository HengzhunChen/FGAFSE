# FGAFSE 

Frozen Gaussian Approximation for Fractional Schrodinger Equation (FGAFSE)

To use this code, cd into the fgafse directory and type FGAFSE_startup in command line or run FGAFSE_startup.m to set up all paths.

You can then cd into the examples directory, and run the corresponding examples.

Currently, FGAFSE appears to need to MATLAB version R2021b or higher. Some earlier versions may not work.
